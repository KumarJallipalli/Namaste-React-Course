        <!-- Method-1: Injecting the React using CDN's, But Not a suggested method
            
        <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
        <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

        Why this above method is NOT suggested to use..?
            - if you are using React without JSX, then using CDN to fetch React library is faster
            - Else Hosting in server is faster than CDN, 
                - cuzz we will do the intense work called compiling & send the minified to browser to execute
                - Hence, reducing the work on client's browser & resulting faster loads of webpage -->
